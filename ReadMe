This file contains a description of all the files used in this project. 
The pre-requisite of this project are:
The system needs to have pre-installed Python3
Pre-installed Anaconda software.
The following files are the dataset:
T_raw_oura_sleep copy.csv
T_raw_oura_activity copy.csv
LYS_file_atest.csv
The following jupyter files have the model code:
T_Oura_Mark2 (actigraphy model)
Light_Mark1  (light Model)
The following files are the output files used in the data processing stage:
file_name.csv
df_sleep.csv
df_ct.csv
To implement the code, the following steps are needed to follow:
Use Jupyter to open the T_Oura_Mark2 file/Light_Mark1 file.
The dataset files need to be in the same directory as the T_Oura_Mark2 file/Light_Mark1 file.
Each cellblock has the appropriate comments to understand the logical reason used to write the code.
The output file will also be saved in the same location as the above files.
T_Oura_Mark2 file and Light_Mark1 file are independent of each other. There is no prerequsite to run any jupyter file before another.
